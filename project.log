Realized the 3200 tweets API limit was actually a thing.
https://twittercommunity.com/t/why-the-3200-tweet-user-timeline-limit-and-will-it-ever-change/6946/7

Wrote script to add users from csv files into the database

Backed up previous database

Modified code so that it rejects users who tweeted about their baby more than 3200 tweets ago

Started mining Data for pregnant people

TODO: modify my R code so that it import the database properly
It needs to plot the intertweetTime distributions

28th of March
Resumed work.
Plot the standard deviation, mean, generate clean graphs for all people with clear units of time and information about people

Aldo's meetings:
CHange axis to days before birth
Find more data
Take a look at what happens before and after pregnancy
Find control data
Average the data in a different fashion so that it doesn't get weighted down by inactivity

Simply mine data from all women/man, get rid of incomplete/weird profiles by hand
Align all the data so that distance between data is minimized:
-- do it using frequency of data using with peaks

----Verify all profiles * pending
----Check data is correctly loaded in R files
----Extend data to one month before/after
Change formula when computing mean so that long zero streaks are not treated
* At this point leave room for data alignment later
Compute mean and all :) Add vertical lines 
Compute same graphs for normal data
Implement the graphs Aldo wanted
Take a look at periodicity test
Look at signal autocorrelation with acf do determine period for females :)

#Â Todo
Generate the Matlab plots 
Generate classification accuracy plots
Generate plots for the data I am using to classify
